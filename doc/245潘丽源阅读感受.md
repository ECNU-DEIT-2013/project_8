Application package

A package that is not intended to be used as a library. 
Application packages may have dependencies on other packages, 
but are never depended on themselves. 
They are usually meant to be run directly, 
either on the command line or in a browser. 
The opposite of an application package is a library package.

Application packages should check their lockfiles into source control, 
so that everyone working on the application and every location the application is deployed has a consistent set of dependencies.
Because their dependencies are constrained by the lockfile, 
application packages usually specify any for their dependencies’ version constraints.


Library package

A package that other packages will depend on. 
Library packages may have dependencies on other packages and may be dependencies themselves. 
They may also include scripts that will be run directly. 
The opposite of a library package is an application package.

Library packages should not check their lockfile into source control, 
since they should support a range of dependency versions. 
Their immediate dependencies’ version constraints should be as wide as possible while still ensuring that the dependencies will be compatible with the versions that were tested against.

Since semantic versioning requires that libraries increment their major version numbers for any backwards incompatible changes, 
library packages will usually require their dependencies’ versions to be greater than or equal to the versions that were tested and less than the next major version.
So if your library depended on the (fictional) transmogrify package and you tested it at version 1.2.1, 
your version constraint would be ^1.2.1.


包（package）可以分为应用软件包（Application package）和库软件包（Library package），
实质上来说是把一些dart文件还有其他后缀的文件封装起来（姑且这么叫吧= =），
应用软件包可以独立地运行，而库软件包只能不停地被导入（import），然后才能使用它里面定义的一些类、方法等。
应用软件包在运行的时候，可以用其他的包里面的类（只要在yaml文件里面get dependencies）。
应用软件包运行如果有html文件的话是可以在浏览器里面运行的，没有的话也可以在命令行里面运行。

库软件包可能包含脚本语言，
库软件包不应该把他的lockfile写到控制源里，因为库软件包需要兼容不同的dependency的版本。
（注明一句，lockfile简单来说，根目录下有一个叫做 pubspec.lock 的文件，它记录了你当前依赖的所有包及其当前使用的版本。）

总的来说，库是用来被重用的代码，包含了需要被别人导入的代码。（这个是在百度上找到的）
基本上算是了结了库，包，还有依赖（Dependencies），导入（import 'package:xxx';->这是导入的应用软件包，import 'dart:xxx'->这是导入了库软件包），等等的具体内容，对yaml文件和lock有了一定的认识（不再不知道它是干什么的了）。
